										<h2>Personal Profile </h2>
									</header>
									<p> I hail from an esteemed and ancient Travancore Nair family, deeply rooted in the rich cultural and historical traditions of Kerala. I was born and raised in Thiruvananthapuram, 
									the vibrant capital city of the state, where I was fortunate to grow up amidst a blend of heritage, education, 
									and modernity that has significantly shaped my values and outlook on life. </p>
									<p>	My father retired as a Manager from the State Bank of Travancore (SBT), having dedicated several years of his life to the banking sector with integrity and commitment. 
									My mother is a devoted homemaker who has played a pivotal role in nurturing our family and instilling strong values in us. 
									I am the youngest of three siblings, with two elder sisters who have both chosen noble careers in education sector. </p>
									<p>	I am married to Lekshmi, a professional singer and postgraduate both music and library science. In 2017, Lekshmi and I left Thiruvananthapuram for Bangalore for my career advancement. 
										Both of us both enjoy singing duets and also conduct personal jam sessions. We also sing Bhajans and compose music for small projects. </p>	
									
									<header class="major">
										<h2>My Musical Journey </h2>
									</header>
									<p> Music is my passion. I spend time playing musical instruments and listening to classical music. I learned the basics of guitar from the Nadabrahma Academy off Fine Arts & Orchestra for a year. 
									Later, I developed my guitar-playing skills on my own. Afterwards, I learned how to play the keyboard and also started playing the harmonium for bhajans. I also learned to play the flute on my own. 
									Now, I can play most of the musical instruments as a novice. 
									I learned more about music from my wife Lekshmi, who is a professional singer and has in-depth knowledge of Indian music. </p>
